# Building
Sunshine binaries are built using [CMake](https://cmake.org) and requires `cmake` > 3.25.
The browser interface is built with Node.js and npm. CMake's `web_ui` target
installs the locked dependencies with lifecycle scripts disabled, generates the
design tokens, type-checks the Vue source, and writes the production bundle to
`<build-dir>/assets/web`. The `sunshine` target and installer packaging depend on
this target, and packaging fails rather than shipping an incomplete
configuration interface.

For frontend-only development, run `npm ci --ignore-scripts` and `npm run dev`
from `src_assets/common/assets/web`. Use `npm run build` for a production bundle.

## Building Locally

### Compiler
It is recommended to use one of the following compilers:

| Compiler    | Version |
|:------------|:--------|
| GCC         | 14+     |
| Clang       | 17+     |
| Apple Clang | 15+     |

### Linux release CUDA compatibility

Linux release packages pin CUDA Toolkit **12.9.1** (runfile build **575.57.08**)
to retain Maxwell, Pascal (including GTX 1070), and Volta GPU targets. CUDA 13
cannot compile those targets. Use GCC 14 as the CUDA host compiler; older
supported builders may use GCC 13. The runfile installs only the toolkit,
not a GPU driver.

The shared Linux build script uses the pinned runfile in `build/cuda` by
default, ignoring a newer system toolkit. It rejects an incompatible cached
toolkit. Arch's PKGBUILD downloads architecture-specific, SHA-256-verified
runfiles into its source directory and explicitly selects GCC 14. Arch CI
installs the signed, versioned GCC 14 packages from the Arch Linux Archive,
because rolling Arch repositories no longer provide them. Manual Arch package
builds also need the `gcc14` build dependency installed.

Release packaging enables `SUNSHINE_REQUIRE_CUDA_PASCAL=ON`, which requires
CUDA 12.9 and the `sm_61` target. Flatpak retains its existing 12.9.1 pin.
When changing toolchain versions, run
`python3 tests/unit/test_cuda_release_policy.py` and build the affected
packages locally before publishing. Developer builds can leave that option
off to use newer CUDA toolkits with a reduced set of GPU targets.

#### Linux
Dependencies vary depending on the distribution. You can reference our
[linux_build.sh](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/blob/master/scripts/linux_build.sh) script for a list of
dependencies we use in Debian-based, Fedora-based and Arch-based distributions. Please submit a PR if you would like to extend the
script to support other distributions.

##### KMS Capture
Do **not** add file capabilities to the `vibepollo` binary. On Linux the public `/usr/bin/vibepollo`
must stay unprivileged; KMS capture runs inside the private `/usr/libexec/vibeshine/vibepollo-host`,
which the package installs with exactly `cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_nice=p`, and the package hook
verifies that the public binary has no capabilities. Install through the Arch package (or follow the
staged-install recipe in `AGENTS.md`) rather than running a capability-patched build directly.

##### CUDA Toolkit
CUDA-enabled builds require CUDA Toolkit **12.0 or newer**. The native
[local build/deploy script](linux/local-development.md#build-settings) uses an
installed toolkit and compiler; it does not pin CUDA 13 or GCC 15. Choose a
host compiler supported by that toolkit and a C++ compiler/standard library
that meets the project's C++23 requirements.

The selected toolkit determines which GPU generations can be targeted. Release
packages deliberately use **CUDA 12.9.1 with GCC 14**, as described above, to
cover both older and newer GPUs. This release pin is not the minimum for local
builds. CUDA 13 removes compilation support for Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta;
upgrading the toolkit can therefore reduce GPU compatibility. See NVIDIA's
[CUDA 13 release notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/13.0.0/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html)
and [CUDA compatibility guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html).

The native Arch/CachyOS release package uses a private build-time toolkit and
does not require users to install the CUDA toolkit to run Vibepollo.

> [!NOTE]
> To install older versions, select the appropriate run file based on your desired CUDA version and architecture
> according to [CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)

#### macOS
You can either use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) to install dependencies.

##### Homebrew
```bash
dependencies=(
  "boost"  # Optional
  "cmake"
  "doxygen"  # Optional, for docs
  "graphviz"  # Optional, for docs
  "icu4c"  # Optional, if boost is not installed
  "miniupnpc"
  "ninja"
  "openssl@3"
  "opus"
  "pkg-config"
)
brew install "${dependencies[@]}"
```

If there are issues with an SSL header that is not found:

@tabs{
  @tab{ Intel | ```bash
    ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/include/openssl /usr/local/include/openssl
    ```}
  @tab{ Apple Silicon | ```bash
    ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/include/openssl /opt/homebrew/include/openssl
    ```
  }
}

##### MacPorts
```bash
dependencies=(
  "cmake"
  "curl"
  "doxygen"  # Optional, for docs
  "graphviz"  # Optional, for docs
  "libopus"
  "miniupnpc"
  "ninja"
  "pkgconfig"
)
sudo port install "${dependencies[@]}"
```

#### Windows

> [!WARNING]
> Cross-compilation is not supported on Windows. You must build on the target architecture.

First, you need to install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org).

For AMD64 startup "MSYS2 UCRT64" (or for ARM64 startup "MSYS2 CLANGARM64") then execute the following commands.

##### Update all packages
```bash
pacman -Syu
```

##### Set toolchain variable
For UCRT64:
```bash
export TOOLCHAIN="ucrt-x86_64"
```

For CLANGARM64:
```bash
export TOOLCHAIN="clang-aarch64"
```

##### Install dependencies
```bash
dependencies=(
  "git"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-boost"  # Optional
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-cmake"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-cppwinrt"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-curl-winssl"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-doxygen"  # Optional, for docs... better to install official Doxygen
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-graphviz"  # Optional, for docs
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-libjpeg-turbo"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-libpng"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-libwebp"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-miniupnpc"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-onevpl"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-openssl"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-opus"
  "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-toolchain"
)
if [[ "${MSYSTEM}" == "UCRT64" ]]; then
  dependencies+=(
    "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-MinHook"
    "mingw-w64-${TOOLCHAIN}-nsis"
  )
fi
pacman -S "${dependencies[@]}"
```

##### WebRTC (optional, Windows only)
Sunshine can link against the libwebrtc C++ wrapper when `SUNSHINE_ENABLE_WEBRTC=ON`. The wrapper source is vendored as
the `third-party/libwebrtc` submodule, but you must build WebRTC separately and provide a staging directory that
contains `include/` and `lib/` (e.g., `libwebrtc.dll` and its import library). We use the `third-party/depot_tools`
submodule for `gclient`/`gn`.

###### Quickstart (recommended)
A helper script automates the full depot_tools / gclient / gn / ninja flow:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build_mingw_webrtc.ps1
```

By default the script builds under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Vibepollo\deps\libwebrtc\src`, stages the reusable SDK under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Vibepollo\deps\libwebrtc\out`, and removes the large source workspace only after verifying the
staged headers, DLL, import library, and completed-build DLL identity. The retained `out` directory is **shared
across every Vibepollo build dir, worktree, and git checkout on the machine**. This means:

- Wiping `build/` does not destroy libwebrtc — the next CMake configure picks it back up.
- A successful local dependency build does not leave the multi-gigabyte Chromium/WebRTC source and Git cache behind.
- A failed build retains its source workspace for diagnosis and retry.
- Multiple Vibepollo build dirs share one small staged libwebrtc SDK.

Pass `-RetainBuildSources` while actively iterating on WebRTC itself. `-Stage Sync` always retains sources because
its purpose is to prepare a later `-Stage Build`; a successful `All` or `Build` stage cleans sources by default.
Explicit `WEBRTC_GIT_CACHE_DIR` or `WEBRTC_DEPOT_TOOLS_DIR` paths outside `WEBRTC_BUILD_DIR` are treated as shared
external caches and are not removed.

`cmake/dependencies/webrtc.cmake` looks at the same default location, so no `-DWEBRTC_ROOT=...` is needed after the
first build. To relocate the cache, set `VIBEPOLLO_DEPS_DIR=<path>` in your environment before invoking either the
script or CMake.

For finer control the script accepts overrides via `-BuildDir`/`-OutDir` parameters or the legacy
`WEBRTC_BUILD_DIR` / `WEBRTC_OUT_DIR` env vars (these still take precedence if set).

###### Manual build (advanced / first-time porting)

If you cannot use the helper script, the underlying steps are:

1. Create a checkout directory and add a `.gclient` that points to
   `https://github.com/webrtc-sdk/webrtc.git@m137_release` with `target_os = ['win']`.
2. Run `gclient sync`.
3. In `src`, add the libwebrtc sources (you can copy or link `third-party/libwebrtc` into `src/libwebrtc`).
4. Apply the audio patch:
   `git apply libwebrtc/patchs/custom_audio_source_m137.patch`
5. Update `src/BUILD.gn` to include `//libwebrtc` in `group("default")`.
6. Generate and build (adjust `GYP_MSVS_OVERRIDE_PATH` if Visual Studio is installed elsewhere; our local install is
   under `D:\Software\Visual Studio`):
   ```bash
   set PATH=D:\sources\sunshine\third-party\depot_tools;%PATH%
   set DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN=0
   set GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2022
   set GYP_GENERATORS=ninja,msvs-ninja
   set GYP_MSVS_OVERRIDE_PATH=D:\Software\Visual Studio
   set vs2022_install=D:\Software\Visual Studio
   set WINDOWSSDKDIR=D:\Software\WinSDK
   cd src
   gn gen out-debug/Windows-x64 --args="target_os=\"win\" target_cpu=\"x64\" is_component_build=false is_clang=true is_debug=true rtc_use_h264=true ffmpeg_branding=\"Chrome\" rtc_include_tests=false rtc_build_examples=false libwebrtc_desktop_capture=true" --ide=vs2022
   ninja -C out-debug/Windows-x64 libwebrtc
   ```
7. Stage the artifacts into a directory with `include/` and `lib/` subfolders. Either place them at the default
   shared cache location (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Vibepollo\deps\libwebrtc\out`) so CMake finds them automatically, or
   point CMake at your staging directory with `-DWEBRTC_ROOT=<path>`. Copy `libwebrtc.dll` and `libwebrtc.dll.lib`
   into `lib/`.
8. Configure Sunshine with `-DSUNSHINE_ENABLE_WEBRTC=ON`. If CMake still fails to find libwebrtc, pass
   `WEBRTC_INCLUDE_DIR` and `WEBRTC_LIBRARY` explicitly.

To create a WiX installer, you also need to install [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### CUDA compatibility for scripted Linux builds

`scripts/linux_build.sh` pins CUDA 12.9.1 and a compatible host compiler to
retain Maxwell, Pascal (including GTX 10-series), and Volta targets. It rejects
incompatible cached toolkits before configuration. Direct CMake builds may
still use newer CUDA with `SUNSHINE_REQUIRE_CUDA_PASCAL=OFF` (the default);
CUDA 13 builds omit those older GPU targets. Set the option to `ON` when
producing a Pascal-compatible build with CUDA 12.9. This does not enable Linux
release publishing in Vibepollo's Windows release workflow.
