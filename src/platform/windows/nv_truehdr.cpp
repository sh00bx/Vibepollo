/**
 * @file src/platform/windows/nv_truehdr.cpp
 * @brief Runtime loader for the MSVC-built TrueHDR shim DLL.
 *
 * Sunshine/Vibeshine builds with MinGW, but the NVIDIA RTX Video SDK ships MSVC libraries,
 * so the NGX TrueHDR work lives in a small MSVC-compiled shim (vibeshine_truehdr.dll, built
 * from tools/truehdr_shim). We load it the same way the rest of the codebase loads optional
 * NVIDIA components (CUDA, NVML): LoadLibrary + GetProcAddress, no link-time dependency. If
 * the shim or the RTX Video runtime isn't present, TrueHDR simply reports unavailable.
 *
 * The shim exposes a tiny C ABI operating on the D3D11 COM pointers we already hold (COM
 * vtables are ABI-stable across the MinGW/MSVC boundary).
